What's this?
------------
hamchat is a small IRC server which acts as a frontend for 
controlling radios and running digital modes.

Your local instance will keep state, etc for your IRC client and
will manage periodically sending messages to the network.

Lots of things are yet to be implemented, please see the 
src/ directory and the files in it to get an idea of the
status of various parts of this project. Feel free to contribute
where you can.

BUGS
-----
There's probably plenty. I've put a few evenings into this...
The better your bug report, the faster I can fix it!

This thing is thrown together as quickly as possible to get it running
while leaving some hope of future cleanup. Dive in, fix stuff!


Why?
----
Because we kept joking about it... So it becomes a thing...
